My Virgin Project

About me:  I'm excellent at logic and I've coded and managed for what was the largest global retail corporation.
Our platform was an IBM 4090, the largest box made by IBM, using a 370 architecture.
Initially we used IBM's VM editor and moved to a TSO environment.
Our database was IMS, a hierarchical style which we then added DB2 under IMS.
Was there a DB1?
Of course ISAM, VSAM, BDAM, etc.
