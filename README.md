My Virgin Project

About me:  I'm excellent at logic and I've coded and managed for what was the largest global retail corporation.  Our platform was an IBM 370 architecture initial using IBM's VM and moving to a TSO environment.  We initially used IMS as our database but quickly moved to DB2.  was there a DB1?  Of course ISAM, VSAM, BDAM, etc.
